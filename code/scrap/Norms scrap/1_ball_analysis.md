# 1-Ball in R³: Geometric Analysis

## Norm Definition
The 1-ball is defined by the norm:
```
||y|| = max{||y||_∞, 1/2 ||y||_1}
```

Where:
- `||y||_∞ = max{|y₁|, |y₂|, |y₃|}` (L∞ norm)
- `||y||_1 = |y₁| + |y₂| + |y₃|` (L1 norm)
- α = 1/2 (weight for L1 norm)

## Geometric Properties

### 1. Coordinate Axes Behavior
For points on the coordinate axes (e.g., (a,0,0)):
- `||(a,0,0)|| = max{|a|, 1/2 × |a|} = |a|`
- The L∞ norm dominates, so the ball extends to ±1 along each axis

### 2. Diagonal Points Behavior
For points like (a,a,0):
- `||(a,a,0)|| = max{|a|, 1/2 × 2|a|} = max{|a|, |a|} = |a|`
- Since 2α = 1, both terms are equal, and the L∞ norm dominates

### 3. Transition Point
The transition occurs when:
- `||y||_∞ = 1/2 ||y||_1`
- This happens when `||y||_1 = 2.0`
- For points with L1 norm > 2.0, the L1 term dominates

### 4. Maximum Extent
- **X-direction**: ±0.999
- **Y-direction**: ±0.999  
- **Z-direction**: ±0.999

The ball extends to approximately ±1 in all coordinate directions.

## Visualizations Generated

### 1. Basic 3D Plot (`1_ball_3d.png`)
- Simple scatter plot showing surface points
- Basic coordinate axes and grid
- Good for understanding the overall shape

### 2. Enhanced 3D Plot (`1_ball_3d_enhanced.png`)
- Multiple layers for solid body appearance
- Surface points in dark blue
- Interior layers in light blue with decreasing opacity
- Key points labeled (A, B, C, D, E)
- Better visualization of the solid nature

### 3. Parametric Surface (`1_ball_parametric.png`)
- Smooth surface representation using parametric coordinates
- Color-coded surface with viridis colormap
- Most accurate representation of the continuous surface
- Best for understanding the exact geometric shape

### 4. 2D Slices (`1_ball_2d_slices.png`)
- XY-plane (z=0): Shows the intersection with the xy-plane
- XZ-plane (y=0): Shows the intersection with the xz-plane  
- YZ-plane (x=0): Shows the intersection with the yz-plane
- Helps understand the 2D cross-sections

## Key Geometric Insights

### Shape Characteristics
1. **Octahedral-like structure**: The ball has sharp corners along the coordinate axes
2. **Smooth faces**: The faces connecting the corners are curved, not flat
3. **Symmetry**: The ball is symmetric with respect to all coordinate planes and axes
4. **Non-convexity**: The ball is not convex due to the mixed norm structure

### Mathematical Properties
1. **Unit ball**: All points on the surface have norm exactly equal to 1
2. **Interior**: All points inside have norm < 1
3. **Exterior**: All points outside have norm > 1
4. **Continuity**: The surface is continuous but not necessarily smooth everywhere

### Comparison with Standard Norms
- **L∞ ball**: Would be a cube with vertices at (±1, ±1, ±1)
- **L1 ball**: Would be an octahedron with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1)
- **Our mixed norm**: Creates a hybrid shape that combines properties of both

## Applications and Significance

This type of mixed norm is often used in:
1. **Optimization problems** where different types of regularization are needed
2. **Machine learning** for feature selection and sparse modeling
3. **Signal processing** where both peak values and total energy matter
4. **Geometric analysis** to understand the interplay between different distance measures

## Technical Implementation Details

The visualization uses:
- **Point sampling**: Random generation followed by filtering for surface points
- **Layered rendering**: Multiple interior layers for solid appearance
- **Parametric surfaces**: Spherical coordinate system for smooth surface generation
- **Binary search**: Efficient algorithm for finding surface points in any direction

## Conclusion

The 1-ball with norm max{||y||_∞, 1/2 ||y||_1} creates an interesting geometric object that:
- Extends to ±1 along coordinate axes (L∞ dominated)
- Has curved faces connecting the corners
- Exhibits octahedral-like symmetry
- Provides a bridge between L∞ and L1 geometries

This visualization demonstrates how mixed norms can create complex, non-standard geometric shapes that are important in various mathematical and engineering applications.
