Subsequently, we create a second, hybrid family named F-Fanions, by constructing convex combinations of the Ky Fan norms with the Frobenius norm and taking dual of that composite norm. Working within the linear minimization oracle (lmo) framework~--- which is equivalent (up to a factor) to the trust region approach~--- we derive the explicit update formulas for both algorithm families. Later in \cref {sec:matrix-side} we explain how their updates can be approximated with the same $\mathcal {O}(m n \min \{m,n\})$ complexity as Muon updates are computed via Newton-Schulz iterations.}}{2}{section*.5}%
